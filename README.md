# Linux-WTF

Linus: I kicked Russian people off so Russian cannot take ownership of my work.

People: is he saying (we should support russia | saying we are helping him fighting Russia | saying we are exposing company secret | saying we were supporting russia all along)

Mathematica: You need to cover it up with BitMasks.

Me: Stencils.

# Micro means 10^-6. PERIOD.

nano is o(10^-9).  femt is o(10^

unless he meant like the something of a kernel of is O(10^-6) 

it is realized to have some common base already and if you want to define your standard of measurement you need to be extremely scientific.

Why did high school teach people to think an answer is just an answer?

(also RTOS kernels are there too. Linux kernel is not the silver bullet)

# Linus is working in a remote-slavery industry
